Comprehensive Time Series Analysis and Prediction Toolkit
This Python-based toolkit offers a wide range of tools and models for analyzing and predicting time series data. It integrates classical statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning frameworks to provide a versatile environment for time series analysis. The toolkit is designed to handle various types of time series data, supporting tasks from basic data processing to complex forecasting challenges.

Features
Statistical Models: Includes implementations of ARIMA and AR models for time series forecasting, equipped with functionalities to evaluate and select the best model configurations based on given data.
Machine Learning: Utilizes Random Forest Regressor for time series prediction, allowing for feature importance analysis and robust prediction capabilities.
Deep Learning: Implements LSTM networks using TensorFlow and Keras for high-level abstractions, tailored for sequential data predictions.
Data Preprocessing Tools: Offers utilities for differencing time series to achieve stationarity, seasonal decomposition, and data normalization/scaling techniques to prepare data for modeling effectively.
Model Evaluation: Provides functions to compute Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for model performance assessment, along with utilities for stationarity testing and model diagnostics.
Genetic Algorithm (GA) & Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) Evaluation: Experimental features for optimizing neural network architectures and parameters using GA and BPTT techniques for superior forecasting performance.
Installation
Clone this repository and ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/pamanh97/RNNcombinedRF
cd time-series-toolkit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the toolkit, import the necessary modules in your Python script or Jupyter notebook. Here's a simple example to get started with ARIMA modeling:

python
Copy code
from your_module import ARIMAModel

# Load your time series data
data = ...

# Initialize and fit the model
arima_model = ARIMAModel(order=(1,1,1))
arima_model.fit(data)

# Predict future values
predictions = arima_model.predict(n_periods=10)
print(predictions)
For detailed usage of each model and utility function, refer to the individual module documentation within the toolkit.
